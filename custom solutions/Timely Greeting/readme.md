# Timely Greetings

Enables the bot to dynamically greet the user with "Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening" or any custom greeting based on their time of day. 

**To use:**

1. Copy & paste the contents of `Timely-Greeting.js` into a new action in your bot.
2. You can pass appropriate greetings as parameters, or pass element IDs for existing content elements
> If you want to have alternatives for each timely greeting, you should put them in a text element and pass its ID into this action
3. Call the action where appropriate in your bot!

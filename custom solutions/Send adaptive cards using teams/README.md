This is an action that can be used to send adaptive cards with teams

As long as the Teams channel is configured properly, this action "should" work.
It's possible that some URLs might need to be changed depending on the region or information on Azure.

The adaptive cards example was taken from: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference#adaptive-card
